## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#import libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(zoo)
library(renv)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
#import the dataset
dataset <- read_csv("HPI_master.csv")
#take a quick look at the dataset
dataset
```


```{r}
#seperate monthly from quarterly into distinct dataframes

#filter monthly
dataMonth <- dataset %>% 
  filter(frequency == "monthly")
dataMonth

#filter quarterly
dataQuart <- dataset %>% 
  select(place_name, yr, period, index_nsa, frequency) %>% 
  filter(frequency == "quarterly") %>% 
  mutate(date = yq(paste0(as.character(yr), "Q", as.character(period)))) %>% 
  unnest(everything())
summary(dataQuart)
dataQuart


```

From here on, we will focus on using the quarterly dataset since it includes key information regarding the home prices by MSA (metropolitan Statistical Area). MSA is a useful way to create panels to our data and allows us to control for regional variance.

Our quarterly dates are in doubles for year and quarter. We need to mutate them into a date column so we can do a proper time series analysis

```{r}
dfQ <- as_tibble(dataQuart) %>% 
  select(date, place_name, index_nsa) 
dfQ 

```

```{r}
#version if you want a smaller dataset

# dfp <- dfQ %>% 
#   filter(date <= "2021-10-01", date >= "1997-01-01") %>% 
#   slice(1:5200) %>% 
#   pivot_wider(names_from = place_name,  values_from = index_nsa)
# 
# dfp

```
```{r}
df30y <- dfQ %>% 
  select(date, place_name) %>% 
  filter(date <= "2021-10-01", date >= "1992-01-01") %>% 
  count(place_name) %>% 
  filter(n >= 120)

df30y



df <- dfQ %>% 
  inner_join(df30y, c("place_name" = "place_name")) %>% 
  select(!n) %>% 
  filter(date <= "2021-10-01", date >= "1992-01-01") %>% 
  slice(1:52000) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = place_name,  values_from = index_nsa)

df

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
